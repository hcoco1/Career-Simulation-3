### Instructor Feedback

- Well done!! This looks fantastic with excellent screenshots and descriptions. Great work with the simple descriptions of tooling. 

-Some ideas:
- Consider adding exact input for the sql command injection (I see it is on most of the screenshots so all good), rather than just showing the output. Often times when reporting bugs, the company needs to know how to recreate the issue so that they can address it. 

- In simplest terms a vulnerability is a weakness. Consider using a framework to get a qualitative/quantitative score. https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-cvss/
  
- How is the presence of a pem key file a high vulnerability? 
- How is having HTTP (1013/tcp) a high vulnerability?
- How is a .sh maintenance script a high vulnerability?
