# **The Penetration Testing**
!!! note ""
## Scenario


 Fullstack Academy has reviewed your teamâ€™s report and is satisfied with the results. Because your team did such a great job, they would like a follow-up penetration test with an isolated portion of the network that was not part of the original engagement. However, this isolated portion of the network has a small number of systems, so it does not make sense for your entire team to be involved with this follow-up engagement. Instead, your team has assigned you to complete the penetration test for this isolated network on your own, as you have proven yourself ready to handle this kind of engagement.

## Rules of Engagement

- You are authorized only to scan and attack systems that reside on the same /20 subnet on which your Kali instance resides (e.g., if the IP of your Kali instance is 172.31.6.161, you are only authorized to scan and attack systems on the 172.31.6.0/20 subnet).
- No social engineering or client-side exploits are needed or permitted on this penetration test.
- You are allowed to work with your classmates on this penetration test.
- Everything you need to complete this test should be available to you on the systems already; there should be no need to download outside tools for this penetration test.
