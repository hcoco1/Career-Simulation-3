# **Introduction**

In this career simulation, you will use your newfound knowledge of vulnerability assessment and risk management to work through a problem. Using techniques learned in this bootcamp, you will examine and explain which tools and techniques to use for the best possible outcomes. Additionally, you will write a penetration testing report for your client that documents your findings.

## Learning Objectives

Your deliverable for this career simulation should demonstrate an understanding of the following learning objectives. These objectives will be used for grading.

### Vulnerabilities Assessment

- Exhibit ethical hacking protocols to evaluate the security of and identify vulnerabilities in target systems, networks, or system infrastructure.
- Perform vulnerability scanning using a variety of tools.
- Use and configure tools to perform offensive security techniques.
- Use modules within Metasploit and explain their purpose.
- Establish Meterpreter sessions and explain how to use them.
- Search for privilege escalation opportunities through lateral movement.
- Apply the pass-the-hash technique to take advantage of flaws in NTLM authentication.

### Interpersonal Skills

- Develop constructive and cooperative working relationships.
- Identify problems using a group approach and develop solutions based on group consensus.
- Apply active listening skills by using reflection, restatement, questioning, and clarification.
- Convey information clearly, correctly, and succinctly.
- Respond appropriately to positive and constructive feedback.
- Reach agreements that promote mutual goals and interests.

### Problem Solving

- Observe and evaluate the outcomes of implementing solutions to assess the need for alternative approaches and to identify lessons learned.
- Recall previously learned information that is relevant to the problem.
- Use a security mindset to identify assets and security goals, potential adversaries and threats, and potential weaknesses.
- Have sufficient inductive and deductive reasoning abilities to do the job successfully.
- Use man pages to learn about unfamiliar commands or switches.
