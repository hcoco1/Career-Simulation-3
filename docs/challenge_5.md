# **Challenge 5: Password Cracking**
!!! note ""
## **Procedure:**

With a password hash in our hands, we need to crack it to discover the actual password. 

- With any means you prefer, crack the MD5 hash you found to reveal the original password. 
    - You can crack the hash using existing tools installed in Kali. (Remember the available wordlists in /usr/share/wordlists!)
    - You could write a Python script to crack it using the same wordlists as other tools.
    - You can check third-party hash databases to see if it is a known hash.
